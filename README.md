**Design, deploy, and operate a complex system with multiple microservices using Docker and Kubernetes**

## What is this book about?
Microservices architecture helps create complex systems with multiple, interconnected services that can be maintained by independent teams working in parallel. This book guides you on how to develop these complex systems with the help of containers.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover how to design, test, and operate scalable microservices 
* Coordinate and deploy different services using Kubernetes 
* Use Docker to construct scalable and manageable applications with microservices 
* Understand how to monitor a complete system to ensure early detection of problems 
* Become well versed with migrating from an existing monolithic system to a microservice one 
Use load balancing to ensure seamless operation between the old monolith and the new service

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class ThoughtModel(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(50))
    text = db.Column(db.String(250))
    timestamp = db.Column(db.DateTime, server_default=func.now())
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is aimed at developers or software architects who work with complex systems and want to be able to scale the development of their systems.

It is also aimed at developers who typically deal with a monolith that has grown to a point where adding new features is difficult and development is difficult to scale. The book outlines the migration of a traditional monolithic system to a microservice architecture, providing a roadmap covering all the different stages.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-).
### Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-10 | Python 3.8 | Windows/Linux/macOS |
